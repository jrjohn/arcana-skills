--style raw Less AI stylization
--no text   Exclude text
--q 2       High quality

## Prompt Best Practices

### DO ✓

1. **Be specific** - "heart with pulse line" instead of "heart"
2. **Specify colors** - Use hex codes "#2196F3"
3. **Specify size** - "1024x1024 resolution"
4. **Specify style** - "flat design", "Material Design"
5. **Exclude text** - "no text, no letters"
6. **Specify purpose** - "for iOS and Android app stores"

### DON'T ✗

1. Vague descriptions - "a nice icon"
2. Too many elements - describing too many things at once
3. Contradicting instructions - "minimal but detailed"
4. Ignoring size - letting AI decide
5. Requesting text - App Icons should not have text

### Iterative Optimization

1. Generate basic version first
2. Observe results, adjust prompt
3. Add/reduce details
4. Adjust style keywords
5. Try different tools and compare results
